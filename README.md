Hiya! I'm Link, if you're here from ponytown please read byi!

21 years old â™’ Feb 2nd â™¡

I have social and generalized anxiety, depression, PTSD/C-PTSD, and am easily overwhelmed by overly crowded spaces in game. Tagtones are not required but very appreciated especially if I don't know you!

While I don't personally believe touch triggers exist in games, I don't think it's necessary to point it out. If I do trigger you in this way, lmk, I will always respect your opinion/boundaries.

Please talk to me about dilfs ðŸ‘€ don't be afraid to goon, either. Seriously, I'm a weirdo â™¡

DNI â¤µ 

Hard-core HH/HB fans. I'm hesitant on the show, my opinions are my own.

CoD fandom. I enjoy the characters and the storyline, but I don't want anything to do with you if you can't act like a decent person and filter your CoD personality.

Resident Evil fandom. I have trauma surrounding it. maybe some day I will be more open to it.

General DNI criteria. Just don't be a creep and please ftlog respect my boundaries.
