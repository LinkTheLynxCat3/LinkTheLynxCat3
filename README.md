Hiya! I'm Link, if you're here from ponytown please read byi!
DNI: 
hard-core HH/HB fans. I'm hesitant on the show, my opinions are my own.
CoD fandom. I enjoy the characters and the storyline, but I don't want anything to do with you if you can't act like a decent person and filter your CoD personality.
Resident Evil fandom. I have trauma surrounding it. maybe some day I will be more open to it.
General DNI criteria. Just don't be a creep.
